/// TechCenter (Tornie mod) — Palace-equivalent building.
///
/// Per Tornie spec: behaves like a Palace but instead of producing a
/// special weapon (Death Hand / Saboteur / Fremen), spawns 1-3 random
/// vehicles around itself when House IX is unlocked for that house.
/// The spawned units default to Area Guard behaviour. TechLevel 9 —
/// this is the last building unlocked in the Tornie tech tree.
///
/// Stats come from ObjectData.ini under [Tech Center]. Production
/// of vehicles is gated by the house's unlock state; until the
/// matching house reaches its per-house IX-unlock (TechLevel(R) = 9
/// typically), no vehicles spawn.
