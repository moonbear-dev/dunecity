"""
Pack two SimCity-style cities onto the user-created
"2P - 192x192 - SimCity.ini" map. Each city sits on one of the two
largest connected rock pieces and aims to cover ~60% of that rock with
structures + roads.

Strategy per rock piece:
- 4-connected flood fill to identify the rock component.
- Reserve a NW "Dune backbone" strip (ConstYard, Windtraps, Refinery,
  Silos, Repair Yard, factories, Nuclear Plant, Outpost) at fixed
  relative offsets within the bbox, snapping to rock-only cells.
- Cover the rest of the rock with a 3x3 lot grid:
    - top-left 2x2 of each lot = R/C/I zone or Police Station
    - rightmost column + bottom row of each lot = roads
  This gives ~5/9 ≈ 55% nominal coverage; we tune to hit ~60% by
  pushing extra road tiles into still-empty rock cells around the
  built area until we cross the threshold.
- Defensive turrets are sprinkled around the city's outer rim.

Edits the file in place. Idempotent: previous [STRUCTURES] blocks and
auto-generated UNITS for Player1/Player2 are removed before re-adding.
