    "DUNE CITY layers a Micropolis-style city simulation on top of\n"
    "Dune II. Build a Construction Yard, lay out roads, drop R/C/I\n"
    "zone tiles, and keep the lights on. The simulation does the rest.\n"
    "\n"
    "1) TURN ON CITY-SIM MODE\n"
    "On first launch Dune City offers an 'Enable now' prompt for the\n"
    "bundled 'dunecity' mod. If you skipped it, open Mods from the main\n"
    "menu, pick 'Dune City', and click Activate. The active mod is\n"
    "shown in the bottom-left watermark.\n"
    "\n"
    "2) START A CITY-SIZED SKIRMISH\n"
    "Single Player -> Custom Game -> pick a large map. The bundled map\n"
    "'2P - 192x192 - SimCity' is designed for city-sim play. City tools\n"
    "only work on rock tiles; sand is for spice and combat as usual.\n"
    "\n"
    "3) LAY DOWN THE BACKBONE\n"
    "- Construction Yard: your anchor. Place on rock first.\n"
    "- Wind Traps / Nuclear Plants: power everything. Without surplus\n"
    "  power, zones decay.\n"
    "- Refinery + Silos: spice income funds the build queue.\n"
    "- Roads: a 'Road' tile appears in the build menu when city-sim\n"
    "  mode is on. Roads carry supply between Industrial, Commercial,\n"
    "  and Residential. Without roads, zones stall at Level 1.\n"
    "Roads cost 10 credits and build instantly. They are not units.\n"
    "\n"
    "4) ZONE THE CITY\n"
    "Three new buildable tiles appear when city-sim is active:\n"
    "- Residential (R): population. Needs jobs and low pollution.\n"
    "- Commercial (C):  jobs and services. Needs people + supply.\n"
    "- Industrial (I):  production. Cluster away from R - pollution\n"
    "  drops land value.\n"
    "Each zone is a 2x2 tile. Zones start empty and develop over time\n"
    "based on land value, power, supply, and crime.\n"
    "\n"
    "5) MANAGE THE BUDGET\n"
    "Population pays taxes annually. Police stations cost upkeep.\n"
    "Open the City Budget window from the HUD to set tax rate and\n"
    "police funding %. Underfunded police -> rising crime -> falling\n"
    "land value -> stalled growth. Every player runs their own budget.\n"
    "\n"
    "6) KEEP GROWING\n"
    "- Spread police stations - they have a coverage radius.\n"
    "- Cluster industry at the city edge.\n"
    "- Watch the power meter; build nuclear before you run out.\n"
    "- Drop an inner Industrial spur near Commercial - C zones need\n"
    "  supply within ~16 tiles via road.\n"
    "\n"
    "COMBAT STILL APPLIES\n"
    "Dune City is layered on top of Dune Legacy. Units, vehicles,\n"
    "ornithopters, sandworms and combat all still work. Play a pure\n"
    "city-builder skirmish on a big rock map, or a hybrid where you\n"
    "defend the colony while it grows.\n"
    "\n"
